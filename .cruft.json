There, we defined 1. `entities`, described by their properties, 2. `fields`, small objects, that are used as `$ref` for certain properties, 3. an `extension`, which contains additional properties, that are not in scope of the JSON schema definition, 4. `i18n` files, that hold translations of the properties and are to be used in the context of user interfaces and 5. `vocabularies`, which are used in context of the `entities`. A more detailed description of the model's context can be found in `/docs/index.md`.",
